# Customer Live Stream Viewing - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Customers can now view live streams as read-only viewers (like Whatnot) instead of joining as active participants.

## What Changed

### 1. New LiveStreamViewer Component
- **File**: `src/components/live-stream/LiveStreamViewer.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Provides a full-screen, viewer-only experience for customers
- **Features**:
  - Read-only video viewing (no camera/mic participation)
  - Full-screen video player with host content
  - Live viewer count display
  - Interaction buttons (heart, chat, share)
  - Audio controls (mute/unmute for viewer)
  - Fullscreen toggle
  - Back navigation to live streams list

### 2. Updated LiveStreamViewerPage
- **File**: `src/pages/LiveStreamViewerPage.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced "Join Live Stream" with "Watch Live Stream"
  - Uses new `LiveStreamViewer` component for viewing
  - Customers see video without being video participants
  - Requires authentication to watch (sign in to watch)

### 3. How It Works

#### For Customers (Viewers):
1. Browse live streams in `/play` (Live tab)
2. Click on a live stream to see details
3. Click "Watch Live Stream" button
4. Experience full-screen video viewing:
   - See the host's video feed
   - Audio controls (mute/unmute)
   - Live viewer count
   - Interaction buttons
   - No camera/microphone participation

#### For Influencers (Hosts):
- No changes to hosting experience
- Still use the full `LiveStream` component
- Customers join as viewers, not participants

## Technical Implementation

### Viewer Authentication
- Customers join 100ms room with `'viewer'` role
- Start with audio/video muted (no participation)
- Can control their own audio (hear the host)

### Video Display
- Custom `HostVideo` component for full-screen viewing
- Shows only the host/broadcaster peer
- Optimized for viewer experience (like watching TV)

### Navigation Flow
```
Live Streams Discovery → Stream Details → Watch Stream → Full-Screen Viewer
     (/play)          →  (/livestream/:id) →    (click)    →    (LiveStreamViewer)
```

## User Experience
- **Before**: Customers would join as video participants (confusing)
- **After**: Customers watch like viewers on Whatnot/TikTok Live (clear and expected)

## Testing Guide
1. **Start a live stream as influencer**:
   - Go to Creator Studio → Live Streaming
   - Start a stream

2. **View as customer**:
   - Open new browser/incognito
   - Sign in as customer
   - Go to Live tab
   - Click on the live stream
   - Click "Watch Live Stream"
   - Should see full-screen viewer experience

## Benefits
✅ **Clear UX**: Customers understand they're viewing, not participating  
✅ **Whatnot-like**: Familiar viewing experience  
✅ **Performance**: Reduced bandwidth (viewers don't send video)  
✅ **Privacy**: Customers don't accidentally share camera/mic  
✅ **Scalable**: Better for large audiences  

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/live-stream/LiveStreamViewer.tsx` (NEW)
2. `src/components/live-stream/index.ts` (updated exports)
3. `src/pages/LiveStreamViewerPage.tsx` (updated to use viewer component)

The implementation is complete and ready for testing!
