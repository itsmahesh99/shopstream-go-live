# Simplified Customer Onboarding - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 🎯 **Main Goal Achieved**
Successfully simplified the customer onboarding process by removing the role selection page and making customer signup the default entry point, while moving business signup links to the footer for easy access.

### 📝 **Key Changes**

#### 1. **Updated Routing (App.tsx)**
- **Before**: `/signup` → Role Selection Page → Customer/Wholesaler/Influencer Signup
- **After**: `/signup` → Directly to Customer Signup Page
- Added direct routes:
  - `/signup/wholesaler` → Wholesaler Signup
  - `/signup/influencer` → Influencer Signup
  - `/signup/customer` → Customer Signup (same as `/signup`)
- Removed `RoleSelectionPage` import and route

#### 2. **Enhanced Footer (Footer.tsx)**
- Added new "Join as Business" section in the footer
- Added prominent links for:
  - **Become a Wholesaler** - "Sell & Supply Products"
  - **Become an Influencer** - "Stream & Earn Commissions"
- Updated grid layout from `lg:grid-cols-5` to `lg:grid-cols-6` to accommodate the new section

#### 3. **Updated Signup Pages**
- **CustomerSignupPage.tsx**: Removed "Back to role selection" button - now clean entry point
- **WholesalerSignupPage.tsx**: Changed back button to go to `/home` instead of role selection
- **InfluencerSignupPage.tsx**: Changed back button to go to `/home` instead of role selection
- Cleaned up unused imports (removed `ArrowLeft` from CustomerSignupPage)
