# Influencer-Viewer Camera Separation Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of camera/video separation between influencers and viewers in the live streaming system. The goal is to ensure that when an influencer is streaming, they only see their own camera feed and not the viewers' cameras.

## Changes Made

### 1. Conference Component Update (`src/components/live-stream/Conference.tsx`)

**Key Changes:**
- Added role-based peer filtering
- Imported `useAuth` hook to access user profile information
- Added logic to filter visible peers based on user role

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
const { userProfile } = useAuth();
const isInfluencer = userProfile?.role === 'influencer';

// Filter peers based on user role
const visiblePeers = isInfluencer 
  ? peers.filter(peer => peer.isLocal) // Only show influencer's own camera
  : peers; // Show all peers for viewers
```

**Behavior:**
- **For Influencers**: Only their own camera (local peer) is displayed
- **For Viewers**: All participants' cameras are displayed (including the influencer)
- **Participant Count**: Still shows the total number of participants for both roles

### 2. User Experience Improvements

**For Influencers:**
- Clean, focused interface showing only their own video feed
- Reduced visual clutter during streaming
- Better focus on their own presentation
- Still aware of total viewer count

**For Viewers:**
- Can see the influencer's camera feed
- Can see other viewers if they have cameras enabled
- Full interactive experience maintained

## Technical Implementation

### Role Detection
The system uses the `AuthContext` to determine user roles:
- `userProfile?.role === 'influencer'` - Identifies influencer users
- Other roles (customer, wholesaler) are treated as viewers

### Peer Filtering Logic
```typescript
const visiblePeers = isInfluencer 
  ? peers.filter(peer => peer.isLocal) // Show only own camera
  : peers; // Show all cameras
```

### Components Affected
1. **Conference.tsx** - Main peer display component (updated)
2. **LiveStreamSimplified.tsx** - Uses Conference component (inherits changes)
3. **LiveStream.tsx** - Uses Conference component (inherits changes)
4. **InfluencerLiveStreamPage.tsx** - Uses LiveStreamSimplified (inherits changes)

### Components NOT Affected
- **LiveStreamViewer.tsx** - Already viewer-specific, only shows host
- **LiveStreamViewerEnhanced.tsx** - Already viewer-specific, only shows host
- **Peer.tsx** - Individual peer rendering (no changes needed)
- **Footer.tsx** - Control buttons (no changes needed)

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Influencer Streaming
1. Influencer starts a live stream
2. Multiple viewers join the stream
3. **Expected Result**: Influencer only sees their own camera
4. **Verification**: Check that `visiblePeers.length === 1` and `visiblePeers[0].isLocal === true`

### Scenario 2: Viewer Watching
1. Viewer joins an active stream
2. **Expected Result**: Viewer sees influencer's camera and other viewers' cameras
3. **Verification**: Check that all peers are visible to viewers

### Scenario 3: Role Switching
1. User switches between influencer and viewer roles
2. **Expected Result**: Camera visibility updates accordingly
3. **Verification**: Component re-renders with correct peer filtering

## Benefits

1. **Improved Focus**: Influencers can focus on their content without viewer camera distractions
2. **Better Performance**: Reduced video rendering for influencers
3. **Professional Appearance**: Cleaner streaming interface for content creators
4. **Maintained Interaction**: Viewers still see all participants for full engagement
5. **Scalable**: Works with any number of viewers without affecting influencer experience

## Future Enhancements

1. **Admin Override**: Allow admins to see all cameras regardless of role
2. **Selective Visibility**: Allow influencers to choose which viewers to display
3. **Picture-in-Picture**: Option for influencers to see viewer reactions in small overlay
4. **Moderator Role**: Special role that can see all cameras for moderation purposes

## Code Quality

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support maintained
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering with minimal overhead
- **Maintainability**: Clean, readable code with clear role-based logic
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
