# Admin Panel Fix - Show All Influencers

## Issue Fixed
The admin panel was only showing the influencer data for the currently logged-in regular user instead of showing ALL influencers. This was because the admin authentication was dependent on regular user authentication.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated AdminPanel.tsx
- Removed dependency on regular user authentication (`userProfile`)
- Admin panel now relies solely on admin authentication system
- Admin status is checked independently of regular user login

### 2. Updated AdminServiceSimple.ts
- Added `admin_get_all_influencers()` function to bypass RLS
- Updated manual token setting to use admin functions
- Added fallback mechanisms for direct database queries

### 3. Created admin-influencer-access-fix.sql
- Database functions that bypass Row Level Security (RLS)
- Admin-specific functions for managing influencers
- Temporary RLS disable for testing

## Steps to Fix

### Step 1: Run the SQL Script
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the content from `admin-influencer-access-fix.sql`
4. Run the script

### Step 2: Test the Admin Panel
1. Clear your browser cache/localStorage
2. Go to `http://localhost:8081/admin/login`
3. Login with admin credentials
4. You should now see ALL influencers, not just the one from regular user login

## What This Fixes
- ✅ Admin panel shows ALL influencers regardless of regular user login
- ✅ Admin authentication is completely separate from regular user auth
- ✅ Manual token input works for any influencer
- ✅ Admin can manage all users independently

## Technical Details
- Admin queries now use `admin_get_all_influencers()` RPC function
- RLS is bypassed for admin operations using SECURITY DEFINER functions
- Fallback to direct queries if admin functions aren't available
- Admin session validation is independent of regular user sessions

**Next Steps:**
1. Run the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard
2. Test the admin login at http://localhost:8081/admin/login
3. Verify all influencers are visible in the admin panel
